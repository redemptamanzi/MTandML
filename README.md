MT: Metamorphic Testing

ML: Machine Learning 

## 1. Application of Metamorphic Testing in Machine Learning 

In the repository, we test the behaviors of different ML algorithms given some transformations on the inputs.

We use Metamorphic relation (MR) to determine which transformations to be made on the data inputs
